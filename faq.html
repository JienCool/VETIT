    <h1 style="color: Blue;text-align:center;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FAQ -
      Frequently Asked Questions:</h1>
    
    <h3 style="color: Green;text-align:center;">The most frequently asked
      questions that are asked by our clients and buyers are:</h3>
    <p style="color:red;"> 1.)&nbsp; How long will it take for an item to some
      back in stock?&nbsp; ----&nbsp; As per request from each individual
      customer, if we do not have what you wish to purchase in stock we will
      order it the same day.Now how long it will take to get to us we do not
      always have the answer for that as there are shipping dates, delays etc..
      It's important that you stay patient with us till we get your order. </p>
    <p style="color:red;"> 2.)&nbsp; Am I able to have a refund if the order
      takes long?&nbsp; ---- Unfortunately, you will not be able request a
      refund unless the object that you receive is broken/damages UPON arrival.
      This is due to us having to buy ourselves for you and due to this we wont
      be able to return the object and get our money back. As said previously if
      an item is not in stock please be patient with us to bring the items back.
    </p>
    <p style="color:red;"> 3.) Is there any way to receive discounts on
      items?&nbsp; ---- This can be a yes and a no. If we are having a special
      offer or maybe seasonal discount then sure but we do not and will not give
      out discounts to random people unless there is some sort of agreement
      between the company and the person with a signed contract/agreement. The
      only fixed discount that we offer is an employee discount that depending
      on your position can go up to 10% off any item.</p>
    <p style="color:red;"> 4.)&nbsp; Will I be able to order online through a
      website or app?&nbsp; ---- For now no, this website is only created to
      show stock and to give some helpful information on the shop and products
      as well as show everyone the FAQ to reduce any confusion. This however
      could be a feature that we would add but however it is not yet an option.</p>
